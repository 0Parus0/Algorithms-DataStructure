## Whats an algorithm?

In computer programming terms, an algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. It takes a set of input(s) and produces the desired output. For example,

# Problem Solving

---

1. ## Understand The Problem

- ### Can i restate the problem in my own words
- ### What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- ### What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
- ### Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
- ### How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

2. ## Explore Concrete Examples

- ### Start with simple examples
- ### Progress to more complex examples
- ### Explore examples with empty inputs
- ### Explore examples with invalid inputs

---

3. ## Break It Down

- ### Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.
- #### This forces you to think about the code you will write before you write it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about details (e.g. language syntax) as well.

4. ## Solve/Simplify

- ### Solve the problem
- #### If you can't --> simplify it
- #### Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to d do
- #### Temporarily ignore that difficulty
  -o
- #### Temporarily ignore that difficulty
- #### Write a simplified solution
- #### Then incorporate that difficulty back in
- ### Solve a simpler problem

5. ## Look Back and Refactor

- ### Congrats on solving it, but you're not done!
- ### Refactoring questions
- ### Can you check the result?
- ### Can you derive the result differently?
- ### Can you understand it at a glance?
- ### Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
- ### Can you improve performance of your solution?
- ### Can you think of the other ways to refactor? do
