# **Problem Solving Patterns**

* ## Frequency Counter
  This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values, this can often avoid the need for nested loops or **O(N^2)** operations with arrays / strings
---
---
* ## Multiple Pointers
  Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning,
  end or middle based on a certain condition
  very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well
---
---
* ## Sliding Window
  This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another, Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)
  very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc
